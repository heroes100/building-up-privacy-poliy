We do not collect, store, or use any personal information directly through the app. However, the app does allow you to sign in with your Google Play account solely to submit your scores to the leaderboards.

When you sign in to the game via Google Play, we may access certain data from your Google Play account, as facilitated by the Google Play Games Services API, to display your leaderboard rankings. This data is only used for the purpose of displaying your scores and ranking within the game.

Types of Data Accessed via Google Play:

Your public profile information, such as your display name and profile photo (only as relevant for displaying on the leaderboard)
Note: This information is provided and managed through Google's services and is subject to Google's own privacy policies.

2. How We Use Your Data

To identify and display your high scores and leaderboard rankings in the game.
We do not store, share, or use any other personal information for any other purpose.

3. Data Retention
We do not retain any personal data on our servers. The data related to your scores and rankings is stored and managed by Google Play Games Services for leaderboard functionality. If you choose to disconnect from Google Play Games, your scores and data may no longer be linked to your Google account.

4. Third-Party Services
Our game utilizes the Google Play Games Services API for signing in and interacting with the leaderboards. Google Playâ€™s privacy practices govern the data collected through their services. You can review Google's privacy policy here: Google Privacy Policy.
